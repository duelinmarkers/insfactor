* insfactor.el
** Format results more pretty like
*** Show content of matched line (though this will sometimes be wrong)
*** incorporate column? Not sure this is useful.
** Fix input reading so it can support strings
* Improve indexing
** Add fn for indexing whole project
** Try :children option to analyze-ns -- might allow killing op->children-fn
** Index :def :meta
*** For most defs, :meta is an :op :constant with a map for :val
*** For tests, :meta is an :op :map with a keyval pair :op :keyword :val :test and :op :fn-expr
*** Probably don't want to index :file, :line, :column, :arglists
** Index :def as usage of defined var
** Index class and/or method in interop-type ops (though they appear in non-interop code)
*** :static-method
*** :instance-method
*** :new
*** Currently just indexing :args for all those
** Index type-hints
** Stop indexing ns expansion? Could ignore almost everything at [1 1]
*** Maybe ignore everything and enhance the index with stuff taken from ns-refers, ns-aliases, etc.
** Other :op :constant types we may want to index
*** regex

* Other functionality
** "insfactor-explain"
*** Looks at position in editor, provides a summary of what's happening there
    e.g., on a fn being invoked, tells you what fn, or if it's a static method
*** Probably requires a different index than find-usages
** "insfactor-rename-var"
** "insfactor-move-def"
** "insfactor-rename-local"
** "insfactor-expand-scope-of-local"
